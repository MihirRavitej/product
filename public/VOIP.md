# VOIP Traffic Analyzer (VTA) Release Document

## 1. Executive Summary
The VOIP Traffic Analyzer (VTA) empowers network and voice operations teams to proactively monitor, analyze, and optimize VOIP traffic quality. This release introduces a Docker-based, modular architecture that ingests logs and telemetry via NETCONF-YANG and protocol-specific collectors, providing real-time insights and alerts. The solution is designed for multi-tenant environments, supports multiple protocols (SIP, RTP/RTCP), and enables rapid operational response.

---

## 2. Requirement Gathering
- Real-time monitoring of VOIP call quality and network performance.
- Support for multiple VOIP protocols (SIP, RTP/RTCP).
- Scalable, containerized deployment (Docker).
- Role-based access and multi-tenant support.
- Integration with existing network management systems.
